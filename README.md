# COR Generator

## Brief Explanation:
This is a progressive coding exercise from CS0035 that will last until the 2nd term. The task is to create
a program with relevance to the given topic which is **"Education"**. Thus, I made a program that generates a 
COR for students who are registered and/or enrolled to the school that will serve as their certificate establishing
a legitimacy that they are enrolled in the school.

## FAQ

#### Who are the target end-users of the program?

Currently, there are two end-users that are the target of the program: **Students**, and **Admin**.

#### How does/will the program help the end-user of your program?

As for the students who will be using the program, not only this will serve as a legitimacy that the student is enrolled
currently in the school, but also this can be used to track their tuition fees. On the other hand, admins, also a 
target end-user for the program can automate the task of registering and enrolling the student without any delays form
manual labor.

## Updates:
 - Added database connection
 - Created custom exceptions
 - Creating an **Admin** class for handling student and user database
